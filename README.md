# SpellingBee

This is a free, automated, textual version of the [New York Times' Spelling Bee game](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee).

Every day, it will serve a different set of 7 letters (1 mandatory, 6 optional), the same for everyone. It will tell you how many words are possible with this set and will let you try to find them all.

Default word lists are provided for English and French, but you can override the URL to another word list. Note that it will automatically remove accents and refuse words with non-alpha characters (like dash or apostrophe).
